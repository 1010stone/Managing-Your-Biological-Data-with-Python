Mybdp, Which is short for Managing Your Biological Data with Python
## Introduction
Such files were originazed by Allegra Via et.. I modified some code while practicing. I like the book and I hope to master it fastly.
## advice
The book was based on python2. So that here are some differences between the the formal code and mine. I suggest people who turn to my code should be careful with the differences. By the way, I just finish some of the fold files. It's better for you to finish the rest ones. Of course, maybe I will do the rest some time latter.
